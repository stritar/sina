# SINA — Phase State

**Single source of truth for phase progress.** Read this to know where we are; do **not** re-audit the repo. Update **only** via the `/phase-status` skill, which re-runs a phase's verification before flipping it to `done`.

See `ROADMAP.md` for the full definition of each phase and its exit criteria.

| Phase | Status | Completed | Verified by |
|---|---|---|---|
| 0 — Foundation Audit & Wiring | done | 2026-06-26 | `pnpm build && pnpm typecheck && pnpm lint` green; theme preset wired in both apps; boundaries enforced via per-package ESLint `no-restricted-imports`; vitest + jest-axe smoke tests pass |
| 0.5 — Agentic Workflow Setup | done | 2026-06-26 | `pnpm build && pnpm typecheck && pnpm lint && pnpm test` all green; `CLAUDE.md` + 5 skills + post-edit hook landed; hook verified to exit 2 on a React-in-theme boundary probe and skip non-source files |
| 1 — Theme & Design Tokens | done | 2026-06-26 | `pnpm build && pnpm typecheck && pnpm lint && pnpm test` all green; tokens land in `packages/theme/theme.css` (`--sina-*` CSS vars) + Tailwind preset (strict override, alpha-aware colors), consumed by both apps; drift + WCAG 2.2 AA contrast tests pass (`pnpm --filter @sina-design-system/theme test`) |
| 2 — Core Primitives | done | 2026-06-30 | `pnpm build && pnpm typecheck && pnpm lint` all green (28 playground primitive routes build clean); `pnpm --filter @sina-design-system/core test` (60 passed / 26 files) + `pnpm --filter @sina-design-system/theme test` (11 passed); micro-grid spacing tokens + off-grid guard `offgrid-utilities.test.ts` in place; Figma hand-off regenerated → file `kRTCdsBg4WpiGxQQGfvoLU` (see [[sina-figma-file]]). NB `pnpm test` aggregate has a pre-existing turbo/vitest concurrency flake ("no tests"), unrelated. |
| 3 — Zod Constitution (governance + fintech) | in-progress | — | — |
| 4 — Playground Test Bed (AI SDK) | not-started | — | — |
| 5 — Governed Fintech Components | not-started | — | — |
| 6 — Defense Logistics | not-started | — | — |
| 7 — Marketing Site & Docs | not-started | — | — |

**Status values:** `not-started` · `in-progress` · `blocked` · `done`.
